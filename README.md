## Overview
_Willow_ is an application for therapists and family/marriage counselors who run their practice on a _Retainer-based_ business model. It specializes in time-tracking and statement generation, and does not require any changes to a user's current payment intake system. Willow simply serves as a helpful tool for counselors to view and manage their clients, as well as generate PDF statements for events occuring over a defined range of dates.

## How Can I Use Willow?
_Willow_ is being developed in collaboration with various marriage and family counselors, and is currently being slated for a target launch of October, 2023.
